# The Pyramidion
Pyramidion Non-Relational Database, v.0.16 (alpha)

(c) 2021 Igor Voloshin ivoloshin@hotmail.com

Programming language: Free Pascal

IDE: Lasarus

Operation system: Ubuntu

This database models an oriented graph consisting of nodes connected with directed edges. Features are the following:
1. Both nodes and edges are stored as elements of the same array, due to reason an edge is essentially a node with one ascending (incoming) and one descending (outgoing) edge;
2. Duplicate and cyclic edges are forbidden here, so Pyramidion is a model of the oriented graph (orgraph) specifically, and not the directed graph;
3. Also orphaned (isolated) nodes are forbidden, thus making Pyramidion to be specifically a model of the connected orgraph To prevent the orphaned nodes appearing each new node is automatically linked with the initial Node 0. It's by far the easiest way, allowing for productivity at the cost of memory space;
4. Types of edges introduced, developping the idea 'Edge is a Node'. These types are just references to nodes, representing edge types, so-called 'property nodes', this typisation mechanism is implemented just to increase the performance and to save storage space;
5. The latest current (still alpha) is v.0.20. I will push it here soon with an extensive wishlist.

Keep an eye here because what was initially started as just another DBMS now has grown to an effort of creating a totally new
RUNIC PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
which is a declarative esoteric language slightly resembling by the idea (NOT by the form) to Haskell and based on the combinatory logic and the Î»-calculus. And on Futhark runes, of course.
